Camagru is the first web project from the 42 / WeThinkCode_ curriculum, that aims to create a simple image editing and sharing application that allows users to post or upload images with frames or stickers, which other users within the application can comment and / or like.

The main purpose for this project was to teach the basic fundamentals of web development using CSS, HTML, JS with PHP acting as the backend / server side language.
